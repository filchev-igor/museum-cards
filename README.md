## About

This project bases on the extracted information from 
the [Victoria and Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/) api.
The idea of the app is to display information as cards with
the possibility of hiding some card in lack of some information
(date, artist name, summary and object history) and sort it
(by the artist name and date). As sample the [data format](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1055401/photograph-beato-felice/) from 
Victoria and Albert Museum taken.
